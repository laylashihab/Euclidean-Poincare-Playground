Given a ruler and a straightedge.

This project was inspired by Euclid's elements and his work with building up a host of mathematical assumptions 
and postulates from a set of 5 axioms. This early geometric work lies at the foundation of people's understanding 
of geometry, taught from a student's early years. However, because of this, many of these assumptions fly under the radar.
I began this project as a way to investigate this early work and identify which of Euclid's 5 postulates I rely on at any given time.
Of particular interest was the 5th axiom. By breaking down this early work and defining everything from a point to a line to basic transformations,
I am gathering a truer sense of these postulates and their interaction with our intuitive knowledge.

While none of the work is novel or new, it is an investigatory project for my own knowledge and benefit. Along the way, I am 
developing my skills in object oriented programming and scalability in projects.
